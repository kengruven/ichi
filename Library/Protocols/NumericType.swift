protocol NumericType {
    // TODO: this can mean lots of things...
}

// FUTURE: complex numbers! -- as Complex<T> where T:RawRealType, maybe?
// - Q: units?

// FUTURE?: bitfields?
// - BETTER?: maybe they're just ints/decs with different bases...
// - then maybe i want int[i] to access the i'th decimal of an int!
