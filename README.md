A numeric framework that doesn't suck

This is a new framework I'm building so that dealing with numbers on my computer doesn't totally suck.

(Admit it.  It does.  You use Google and Siri for basic arithmetic and unit conversions.)

It's going to start as a library.  (Maybe it'll need to be a programming language someday?)  This will be a reference implementation in some language, but the concepts will be language-agnostic.  It's a way of designing an interface that can be implemented in many languages (think SAX).

It will definitely be free software.  It will probably not be a license that's compatible with your BigCo's SuperProprietary.app.  Enabling more hoarding by corporations is not my goal.  Share, damn it.

It might include a sample application, which may or may not run on your particular computer, or be useful to you.
If you are expecting a system similar to existing programming language numeric systems, you'll probably be disappointed.
